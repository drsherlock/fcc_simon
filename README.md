# fcc_simon
Simon is a single player memory game. The objective of the game is to remember the random sequence of colors given by the 
computer. For every correct sequence, one more color will be added to it by the computer. The application will keep score 
of how many times the player gets the correct sequence in every turn. There is a 'strict mode' as well in which player will
have to start all over if he gets a sequence wrong.<br>
The apps works in the browser using frontend technologies only. The designing is done using CSS and Bootstrap, and the 
functionality is provided using jQuery.
